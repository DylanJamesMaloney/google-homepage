<------  THE FIRST ODEN PROJECT ------>

    GOAL

The goal of this project is to reverse-engineer the Google homepage visually, not funtionally, to practice using HTML and CSS.

    THOUGHTS

There are so many ways to accompish the same effect visually and I expiremented with a few while building this page. It's a little sloppy in style and probably looks a little hacked together, but I think it looks pretty good!
